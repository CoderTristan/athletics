You're building a platform for experienced athletes, so you wisely skip AI and instead use smart multiple-choice onboarding to configure a personalized dashboard. Users select their sport, what they track (lifts, recovery, etc.), coaching style, injury status, and goals. Based on their answers, they get a tailored dashboard showing lifts, calendar, goal progress, injury log, recovery, and achievements. You keep the app fully functional without paywalls to build trust and retention. Instead of subscriptions, you monetize through optional tools and experiences that enhance, not restrict. One option is a marketplace for training programs or coaching services, where you take a commission. Another is advanced reporting tools for exporting progress logs or tournament prep summaries. You could also offer physical merch tied to user achievements, or run sponsored challenges from brands. Additional features like a digital training journal or custom rehab trackers can be sold as one-time add-ons. This approach respects serious users, avoids gimmicks, and monetizes through value, not friction.
